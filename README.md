DFA for “EVEN-EVEN” language. 
DFA in a GUI-based Java program. 
The program should allow the user to enter an input string (alphabet set is {a,b}). 
The program then simulate that input on DFA while reading a character and highlighting the current state and 
this process continues until the input expires and eventually program tells the user if the string is accepted or rejected.
